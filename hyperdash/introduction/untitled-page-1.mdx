## Fees

Trades on the Hyperdash Terminal incur a 1bp builder fee (0.01%) on top of the competitive base hyperliquid fee structure (https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees).

Traders are eligible for fee cash backs based on their tier, determined by their trading volume.

Trading volume and quests unlock further tiers which let you get a bigger cut of referral rewards as well as cash back. Referral rates apply only to direct referrals.
