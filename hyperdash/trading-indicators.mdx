**Liquidation and Stop Loss Heatmaps**

Hyperdash supports the most advanced and granular liquidation heatmaps of any platform

Filter by listed asset and time frame to see key levels of liquidations (available in 5m, 15m, 1h and 1d timeframes).\
\
Hyperdash supports 3 different types of heatmap.

### **Live**

See the current live liquidations and stops of current open positions and limit orders. Additionally you can zoom in and click on any horizontal bar level to see an overview of the top liquidations or stops at that level.

### **Depth**

See a granular overview of cumulative long or short liquidations and stops on both the long and short side. Again, you can zoom in and inspect specific levels for an overview of the top positions at each level. You can also toggle between a coin based or dollar based representation of the cumulative amounts.

### Historical

See a historical overview of precise liquidations and stop losses at each level of price. You can also select the colour scheme that best suits your visual preference to see areas of contrast. You can also click on any block of orders to see the liquidations and stop losses present at that time. The colour key scale on the left side indicates the associated size at any level.
