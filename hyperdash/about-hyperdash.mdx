**What is Hyperdash?**

Hyperdash is a performant trading terminal and explorer for trading on Hyperliquid. Hyperdash allows you to dive deeper into traders performance, analyze additional data on the available markets and track, copy or counter trade wallets trading on hyperliquid, through the publicly visible on-chain nature of the underlying hyperliquid protocol.

Hyperdash adds a degree of social-trading to the existing trading experience, where traders can track any traders, from friends to foes. They can also trade together in clans as seen on [pvp.trade](http://pvp.trade), to compete amongst each other as well as against other clans.

In the strive to revolutionize the largely un-innovated upon model of perpetual trading, Hyperdash seeks to gamify trading through various unique game modes, allowing traders to compete for prize pools and rewards, where their trading skills are put to the test in the arena.

**Core contributors**

Hyperdash was acquired by [pvp.trade](http://pvp.trade), and innovated upon to create a new trading terminal with copy trading functionality and pro tools for traders.
