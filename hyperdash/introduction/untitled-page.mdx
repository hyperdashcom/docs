### Onboarding

Login: Users can log in via:

- Google authentication
- Via Email
- Directly via an EVM compatible Wallet

In the case of google or email login, a wallet will be generated for the user to deposit funds with in order to trade.

### Deposits

Deposits can be made directly via multiple methods, no limits and instantly:
