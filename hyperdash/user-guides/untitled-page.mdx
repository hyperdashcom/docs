**Spot vs Perpetuals (brief overview of the difference between spot and perpetuals).**

**Spot**

- You buy or sell the actual asset (like HYPE, BTC, ETH).
- You own it directly, and can transfer it out of the exchange to external wallets.
- Profit only when price goes up (unless you sell what you already hold).

**Perpetual Futures (Perps)**

- You **don’t own the asset**, you trade a contract tied to its price.
- You can go**long ** (bet price goes up) or**short**  (bet price goes down).
- **No expiry date** — you can hold as long as you want, but will earn or incur funding rate payments.
- **Uses leverage:** trade bigger size with smaller capital (Up to **40x Leverage**).
- **Funding rates** keep perp prices in line with the spot market.

**Cross vs Isolated Margin Options**

**Cross positions **are liquidated when the account value (including unrealized profit and loss) is less than the _maintenance margin_ times the total open notional position. The maintenance margin is currently set to half of the initial margin at max leverage.

**Isolated Positions **are liquidated by the same maintenance margin logic, but the only inputs to the computation are the isolated margin and the notional value of the isolated position.

**Leverage Options**

Each pair has an associated leverage options, which you can adjust using the slider.

Market vs Limit order

- **Market: **An order that executes immediately at the current market price
- **Limit: **An order that executes at the selected limit price or better

### Take Profit and Stop Loss

- **Take Profit: **A limit order that is activated to take profits when the price reaches the selected price
- **Stop loss: **A limit order that is activated to minimize losses when the price reaches the selected stop price

### Reverse

- Closes the selected trade and opens an equal trade in the opposite direction (flips longs into shorts and shorts into longs).

### Advanced Order Types

- **TWAP: **Execute orders over time
  - **Randomize (Optional): **If Randomize is enabled, the size of each sub-trade will be automatically adjusted within a certain range, typically up to 20% higher or lower than the original trade size. However, any other requirements specified when creating the TWAP trade, such as ensuring the randomized trade size does not exceed the maximum single trade size, will still be followed.
- **Scale: **Auto-place orders across price range
  - Includes parameters for number of orders and skew amount (Ratio between end and start prices. For example if size skew is 2.0 then a limit order for end price will be placed with twice the size of the start price. A size skew of 1.0 creates equally sized orders.
- **Stop Limit:** Becomes limit order at trigger
- **Stop Market: **Becomes market order at trigger
- **Chase: **Places limit orders at the best bid/ask and continuously updates them until filled.
  - **Chase to:** sets the price to chase to until price exceeds this limit.
  - **Stalk Distance: **Order price stays a fixed distance from best bid.
