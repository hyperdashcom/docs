When viewing a trader, clicking the ‘copytrade’ button will allow you to select between copy and counter trading.

You can configure your copy trading options to:

- Copy every trade regardless of entry price (which will copy their open trades at the market price, at the time you start copytrading).
- Only copy trades with favorable entry prices (copytrades wont be placed unless the market price reaches the traders initial entry).
- Adjust the leverage of the trades taken when copying.

Next users choose to:

- Which wallet to copy trade with (HD native wallet or via import)
- Asset to use as collateral
- % of available margin to copy trade with (Note new deposits will incur a \$1 base Hyperliquid fee).

After reviewing your setup, users can confirm and initiate copy trading. Copy and counter trades will incur a 5bp fee (0.05%).

Active copytrades will be shown in the ‘copy trading’ tab alongside your positions with associated PnLs, and equity allocated.

Upon choosing to stop copytrading, you will be prompted to choose whether to keep current positions open or close them all. Once stopped, copytrading can also be optionally resumed.

Funds allocated to copytrades are transferred to a seperate wallet in your account dedicated to each trader you are copying. Once you have stopped copytrades you can transfer funds from the coptrading wallet to any other belonging to your account.
